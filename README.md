# 👋 Hi, I'm Brolin Remunyanga

I'm a full stack developer focused on Ruby on Rails with 1+ year of real-world experience building features in early-stage SaaS products. I currently work remotely at a startup (Jalappeno) building MVPs for store management, marketing automation, and link-sharing tools.

My experience lies in writing well-tested, maintainable code and integrating modern frontends (React/Next.js) with Rails monoliths and API backends. I've also contributed to performance improvements, architecture cleanup, and developer tooling in a resource-constrained startup environment.

## 🧱 What I Actually Do

- Develop features for a Rails + React monolith powering store management and marketing apps.
- Maintain a Rails API backend with OAuth 2.0 (Doorkeeper) for a Next.js frontend.
- Setup CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, integrated Stripe and Google Analytics 4.
- Wrote test suites: RSpec (unit), Capybara/Cucumber (integration), Cypress (end-to-end).
- Built features like:
  - Soft-delete recovery (Recycle Bin)
  - History & revert (PaperTrail audit logs)
  - Infinite scrolling & lazy loading (Turbo)
  - AI PDF/image analysis for store setup
